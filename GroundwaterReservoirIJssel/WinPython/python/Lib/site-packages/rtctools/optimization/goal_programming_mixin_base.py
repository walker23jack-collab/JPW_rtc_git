class Goal(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    r"""
    Base class for lexicographic goal programming goals.

    **Types of goals**

    There are 2 types of goals: minimization goals and target goals.

    *Minimization goals*

    Minimization goals are of the form:

    .. math::
        \text{minimize } f(x).

    *Target goals*

    Target goals weakly enforce a constraint of the form

    .. math::
        m_{target} \leq g(x) \leq M_{target},

    by turning it into a minimization problem of the form

    .. math::
        \text{minimize } & \epsilon^r, \\
        \text{subject to } &g_{low}(\epsilon) \leq g(x) \leq g_{up}(\epsilon), \\
        \text{and } &0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1,

    where

    .. math::
        g_{low}(\epsilon) &:= (1-\epsilon) m_{target} + \epsilon m, \\
        g_{up}(\epsilon) &:= (1-\epsilon) M_{target} + \epsilon M.

    Here, :math:`m` and :math:`M` are hard constraints for :math:`g(x)`,
    :math:`m_{target}` and :math:`M_{target}` are target bounds for :math:`g(x)`,
    :math:`\epsilon` is an auxiliary variable
    that indicates how strongly the target bounds are violated,
    and :math:`\epsilon^r` is a function that indicates the variation of :math:`\epsilon`,
    where the order :math:`r` is by default :math:`2`.
    We have

    .. math::
        m < m_{target} \leq M_{target} < M.

    Note that when :math:`\epsilon=0`,
    the constraint on :math:`g(x)` becomes

    .. math::
        m_{target} \leq g(x) \leq M_{target}

    and if :math:`\epsilon=1`, it becomes

    .. math::
        m \leq g(x) \leq M.


    **Scaling goals**

    Goals can be scaled by a nominal value :math:`c_{nom}`
    to improve the performance of the solvers.
    In case of a minimization goal, the scaled problem is given by

    .. math::
        \text{minimize } \hat{f}(x),

    where :math:`\hat{f}(x) := f(x) / c_{nom}`.
    In case of a target goal, the scaled problem is given by

    .. math::
        \text{minimize } & \epsilon^r, \\
        \text{subject to } &\hat{g}_{low}(\epsilon) \leq \hat{g}(x) \leq \hat{g}_{up}(\epsilon), \\
        \text{and } &0 \leq \epsilon \leq 1,

    where :math:`\hat{g}(x) := g(x) / c_{nom}`,
    :math:`\hat{g}_{low}(\epsilon) := {g}_{low}(\epsilon) / c_{nom}`,
    and :math:`\hat{g}_{up}(\epsilon) := {g}_{up}(\epsilon) / c_{nom}`.


    **Implementing goals**

    A goal class is created by inheriting from the :py:class:Goal class and
    overriding the :func:`function` method.
    This method defines the goal function :math:`f(x)` in case of a minimization goal,
    and the goal function :math:`g(x)` in case of a target goal.
    A goal becomes a target goal
    if either the class attribute ``target_min`` or ``target_max`` is set.

    To further define a goal, the following class attributes can also be set.

    :cvar function_range:   Range of goal function :math:`[m ,M]`.
                            Only applies to target goals.
                            Required for a target goal.
    :cvar function_nominal: Nominal value of a function :math:`c_{nom}`.
                            Used for scaling. Default is ``1``.
    :cvar target_min:       Desired lower bound for goal function :math:`m_{target}`.
                            Default is ``numpy.nan``.
    :cvar target_max:       Desired upper bound for goal function :math:`M_{target}`.
                            Default is ``numpy.nan``.
    :cvar priority:         Priority of a goal. Default is ``1``.
    :cvar weight:           Optional weighting applied to the goal. Default is ``1.0``.
    :cvar order:            Penalization order of goal violation :math:`r`. Default is ``2``.
    :cvar critical:         If ``True``, the algorithm will abort if this goal cannot be fully met.
                            Default is ``False``.
    :cvar relaxation:       Amount of slack added to the hard constraints related to the goal.
                            Must be a nonnegative value.
                            The unit is equal to that of the goal function.
                            Default is ``0.0``.

    When ``target_min`` is set, but not ``target_max``,
    the target goal becomes a lower bound target goal
    and the constraint on :math:`g(x)` becomes

    .. math::
        g_{low}(\epsilon) \leq g(x).

    Similary, if ``target_max`` is set, but not ``target_min``,
    the target goal becomes a upper bound target goal
    and the constraint on :math:`g(x)` becomes

    .. math::
        g(x) \leq g_{up}(\epsilon).

    Relaxation is used to loosen the constraints that are set
    after the optimization of the goal's priority.

    Notes:
        *   If one is unsure about the function range,
            it is recommended to overestimate this interval.
            However, this will negatively influence how accurately the target bounds are met.
        *   The function range should be strictly larger than the target range.
            In particular, :math:`m < m_{target}` and :math:`M_{target} < M`.
        *   In a path goal, the target can be a Timeseries.
        *   In case of multiple goals with the same priority,
            it is crucial that an accurate function nominal value is provided.
            This ensures that all goals are given similar importance.

    A goal can be written in vector form. In a vector goal:
        * The goal size determines how many goals there are.
        * The goal function has shape ``(goal size, 1)``.
        * The function is either minimized or has, possibly various, targets.
        * Function nominal can either be an array with as many entries as the goal size or have a
          single value.
        * Function ranges can either be an array with as many entries as the goal size or have a
          single value.
        * In a goal, the target can either be an array with as many entries as the goal size or
          have a single value.
        * In a path goal, the target can also be a Timeseries whose values are either a
          1-dimensional vector or have as many columns as the goal size.

    **Examples**

    Example definition of the point goal :math:`x(t) \geq 1.1` for :math:`t=1.0` at priority 1::

        class MyGoal(Goal):
            def function(self, optimization_problem, ensemble_member):
                # State 'x' at time t = 1.0
                t = 1.0
                return optimization_problem.state_at('x', t, ensemble_member)

            function_range = (1.0, 2.0)
            target_min = 1.1
            priority = 1

    Example definition of the path goal :math:`x(t) \geq 1.1` for all :math:`t` at priority 2::

        class MyPathGoal(Goal):
            def function(self, optimization_problem, ensemble_member):
                # State 'x' at any point in time
                return optimization_problem.state('x')

            function_range = (1.0, 2.0)
            target_min = 1.1
            priority = 2

    **Note path goals**

    Note that for path goals, the ensemble member index is not passed to the call
    to :func:`OptimizationProblem.state`.  This call returns a time-independent symbol
    that is also independent of the active ensemble member.  Path goals are
    applied to all times and all ensemble members simultaneously.
